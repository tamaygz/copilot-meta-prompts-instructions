You are an expert code reviewer. Review the $project for old, unused, or obsolete code. Identify:

- Functions, classes, files or folders that are no longer used or referenced.
- Deprecated APIs or outdated patterns.
- Code that can be safely removed or updated for modern best practices.

For each finding, provide:
- The file and line number(s).
- A brief explanation.
- A recommended action (remove, update, refactor).

Do not make changes yetâ€”just list and explain the findings.
