# Documentation Strategy

- Only the `README.md` file should be placed directly in an app or project directory.
- All other documentation files must be stored in the corresponding `app/docs/` folder.
- Do **not** create separate "update log" or "changelog" documentation files for session-based changes. Instead, keep existing documentation up to date by editing the relevant files as needed.
- Ensure all documentation is clear, concise, and follows markdown best practices.
- Use consistent naming conventions and structure across all documentation files.

> These guidelines help maintain organized, accessible, and maintainable documentation for all projects.
